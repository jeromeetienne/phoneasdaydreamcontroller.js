# TODO
- bail out phoneasvrcontroller when a real controller is connected
  - keep actual API around, and if there is one connected, answer the real gamepads
  
- do we provide timestamp ? i think the real gamepads do

- DONE port all demo to pure gamepad API
  - overload stuff with it
- DONE do a threex.vrcontrollermodel.js
  - use the model and mirror with the gamepad
- DONE it is named touchpad all over my code... is that a trackapd or a touchpad ?
