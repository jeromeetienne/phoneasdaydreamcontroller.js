- make a pause/seek in the player

- started theex.webvrrecorder.js

- file are getting huge... how to do better ?
  - store only delta
  - store in binary
- LATER save in binary - should i record in json ?
  - large files => slow download + huge memory usage
  - what are the alternatives ? to save in binary
  - what about after you did json ?
  - yeah no emergency
- DONE merge with https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threejs-video-augmentedreality


----
- DONE test replay on vive ?
